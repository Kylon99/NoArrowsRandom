# ![IMG](NoArrowsRandom/Resources/NoArrowsRandom64.png) NoArrowsRandom

* Do you miss the No Arrows mode from 0.12 and before where the block colors would sometimes be swapped?  
* Do you play Darth Maul style in No Arrows but find some maps are too easy with red blocks always on the left and blue to the right?

This mod restores the randomized No Arrows mode from previous versions for custom maps as a game modifier.  It will convert all Standard mode maps, custom or original BeatSaber songs into No Arrows Random but it will disable score submission.  It will not transform or disable scoring when playing One Saber mode or No Arrows maps that were created by the mapper.
